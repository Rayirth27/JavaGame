# JavaGame
It is an indie game made using Java programming language.
The whole motive of this project is to learn the deep concepts of core Java and get used to the techniques of applying various libraries and frameworks.
This project paves the way for the new concept of coding and how can we, users, use technology to express our thought processes in the code.
This project will act like a milestone which inspires me as a programmer to strive, learn and explore new ways of programming.
This approach helps others to add their creativity to the code and learn along the process.
